## Suggested description of the vulnerability for use in the CVE

```
A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in admin/del.php at line 89. The application directly inserts the value of the parameter "pagename" into the HTML response without proper sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, which includes a malicious Referer header. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially resulting in session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
